# Satellite-communication-system-project
In this project, you will learn how to plan, implement, analyse and simulate satellite communication systems 
in compliance with the latest digital video broadcasting â€“ satellite DVB-S2 standard.  
The project consists of five parts. Part I involves link budget calculations, where signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) 
are determined to satisfy a certain performance requirement. Part II involves baseband simulations the DVB-S2 standard. 
Part III aims to simulate the DVB-S2X non-constant envelope modulation schemes, which are not available in MATLAB. The 
objective of Part IV is to develop an adaptive coding scheme at the satellite transponder, which adjusts the transmission 
parameters to the reception conditions of terminals, e.g., switching to a lower code rate during rain. Part V deals with 
developing and implementing diversity and combining techniques by using multiple antennas at the receiver at the customer 
premises to improve the satellite signal transmission. Part VI is a project presentation highlighting your results obtained 
in the other parts.
